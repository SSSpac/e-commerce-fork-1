This is Feedback for the original project:

Overall very nice project with a good checkout system. one comment I have about some tests is that they mention what the code does. 

but I think having tests that are targeted towards why the it matters to the user, instead of ""calls addToCart when button is clicked" try "after this is clicked the correct product is added to the cart".

Also the mock is only testing the "name" it should also test the "id,price" and so on from the props.

Some more tests for the sidebar could have been aded, like "have the user pressed the cart ?" or "close the cart after clicking twice"
